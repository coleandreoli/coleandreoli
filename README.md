## Hi there 👋

I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades and a professional problem solver. Currently studying Space Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) 🎓 and working as a software engineer at Agritheory.
You'll find me working on optimization problems, working with lots of data, and building rockets 🚀.
